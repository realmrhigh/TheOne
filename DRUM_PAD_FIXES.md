# Drum Pad Sample Loading Fixes

## Issue Summary
Drum pads were not loading samples correctly due to initialization timing and error handling issues in the `DrumTrackViewModel`.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Race Condition in Sample Loading**
The `loadInitialSamples()` function was being called in the `init{}` block, but the audio engine initialization is asynchronous. This could cause samples to attempt loading before the AssetManager was properly set up.

### 2. **Missing Sample Path Prefix**
One sample path was missing the `asset://` prefix (line changed from `"test.wav"` to `"asset://test.wav"`).

### 3. **Poor Error Handling**
Limited logging and error handling made it difficult to diagnose why samples weren't loading.

### 4. **No Loading State Tracking**
There was no way to track whether samples had been loaded successfully before trying to trigger them.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Sample Loading State** (`DrumTrackViewModel.kt`)
```kotlin
private val _samplesLoaded = MutableStateFlow(false)
val samplesLoaded: StateFlow<Boolean> = _samplesLoaded.asStateFlow()
```
This allows the app to track whether samples have been loaded successfully.

### 2. **Improved Sample Loading Sequencing**
- Added explicit wait for audio engine initialization to complete
- Added small delay (100ms) after initialization to ensure AssetManager is fully ready
- Sequential sample loading with individual error handling per sample
- Detailed logging showing success/failure count

```kotlin
private fun loadInitialSamples() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        try {
            println("DrumTrack: Starting sample loading...")
            
            // Initialize the audio engine first and wait for it to complete
            val initialized = audioEngine.initialize(44100, 256, true)
            if (!initialized) {
                println("DrumTrack: ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio engine initialization failed")
                return@launch
            }
            
            println("DrumTrack: ‚úì Audio engine initialized successfully")
            
            // Small delay to ensure AssetManager is fully set up
            kotlinx.coroutines.delay(100)
            
            var successCount = 0
            var failCount = 0
            
            // Load each pad's sample sequentially
            _padSettingsMap.value.forEach { (padId, padSettings) ->
                // ... detailed per-sample loading with error handling
            }
            
            _samplesLoaded.value = true
            println("DrumTrack: Sample loading completed - Success: $successCount, Failed: $failCount")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("DrumTrack: ‚úó Failed to load initial drum samples: ${e.message}")
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Pad Trigger Logic**
Added check to prevent triggering pads before samples are loaded:

```kotlin
fun onPadTriggered(padId: String) {
    _activePadId.value = padId
    
    viewModelScope.launch {
        try {
            val padSettings = _padSettingsMap.value[padId]
            if (padSettings != null && padSettings.layers.isNotEmpty()) {
                // Check if samples are loaded
                if (!_samplesLoaded.value) {
                    println("DrumTrack: ‚ö†Ô∏è Samples not yet loaded, skipping pad trigger")
                    _activePadId.value = null
                    return@launch
                }
                
                // Trigger sample...
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("DrumTrack: ‚úó Failed to trigger pad $padId: ${e.message}")
            _activePadId.value = null
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
Added detailed logging throughout the sample loading and triggering process:
- `‚úì` for successful operations
- `‚úó` for failures
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` for warnings
- Clear messages showing what's happening at each step

### 5. **Fixed Sample Path**
Corrected the fallback sample path to include the `asset://` prefix.

## Testing

### To Test Drum Pads:
1. Launch the app
2. Navigate to the Drum Pad screen (ü•Å THE ONE MPC)
3. Check logcat for sample loading messages:
   ```
   DrumTrack: Starting sample loading...
   DrumTrack: ‚úì Audio engine initialized successfully
   DrumTrack: ‚úì Loaded Pad0 (Kick) from asset://drum_kits/trap_808_king/kick_808.wav
   DrumTrack: ‚úì Loaded Pad1 (Snare) from asset://drum_kits/trap_808_king/snare_electronic.wav
   ...
   DrumTrack: Sample loading completed - Success: 16, Failed: 0
   ```
4. Tap any drum pad - you should hear the sample play
5. Each pad has a different sample from the trap_808_king drum kit

### Expected Behavior:
- All 16 pads should load successfully
- Tapping a pad should trigger the sample immediately
- Visual feedback (pad glows green) when triggered
- Log messages show successful sample loading and triggering

## Drum Kit Samples Loaded
The following samples from the `trap_808_king` kit are loaded:
1. **Kick** - kick_808.wav
2. **Snare** - snare_electronic.wav
3. **HiHat** - hihat_trap.wav
4. **Clap** - clap_trap.wav
5. **808** - bass_808.wav
6. **Tom** - tom_electronic.wav
7. **Kick2** - kick_simmons.wav
8. **FX** - effect_reverse.wav
9-16. Fallback samples (kick.wav, snare.wav, hat.wav, clap.wav, test.wav, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Audio Engine Flow:
1. `AudioEngineImpl.initialize()` is called
2. Native `native_initialize()` sets up Oboe audio stream
3. `native_setAssetManager()` is automatically called after successful init
4. Each sample is loaded via `loadSampleToMemory()` which:
   - Detects `asset://` prefix
   - Calls `loadSampleFromAsset()` 
   - Uses Android AssetManager to read file
   - Parses WAV with dr_wav
   - Stores in sample map for playback
5. `triggerSample()` plays the loaded sample

### Key Files Modified:
- `app/src/main/java/com/high/theone/features/drumtrack/DrumTrackViewModel.kt`

### Related Files (No Changes):
- `app/src/main/java/com/high/theone/audio/AudioEngineImpl.kt` - Already handles AssetManager correctly
- `app/src/main/cpp/AudioEngine.cpp` - Sample loading logic working correctly
- `app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp` - JNI bindings working correctly

## Build Status
‚úÖ Build successful
‚úÖ APK installed on device
‚úÖ Ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Test the drum pads on device and verify audio playback
2. Check logcat output for any loading failures
3. If issues persist, check that:
   - All WAV files exist in `app/src/main/assets/drum_kits/trap_808_king/`
   - Audio permissions are granted
   - Device has working audio output
