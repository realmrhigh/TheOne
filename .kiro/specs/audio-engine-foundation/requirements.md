# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing the core Audio Engine (C1) foundation in TheOne MPC app. The audio engine serves as the critical foundation that enables all audio functionality including sample playback, real-time processing, and low-latency performance. This module must be implemented first as it provides the essential audio infrastructure that all other features depend on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly initialized audio engine using Oboe, so that the app can achieve low-latency audio performance on Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audio engine is initialized THEN the system SHALL use Google Oboe library for optimal Android audio performance
2. WHEN initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL negotiate the best available sample rate with the Android audio system
3. WHEN initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL report the achieved sample rate and buffer size
4. IF initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the failure reason
5. WHEN the engine is running THEN the system SHALL maintain audio latency below 50ms for real-time performance
6. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL properly pause audio processing to conserve resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust JNI bridge between Kotlin and C++, so that the UI can control audio operations safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kotlin code calls audio functions THEN the system SHALL route calls through properly implemented JNI bindings
2. WHEN JNI functions are called THEN the system SHALL handle type conversion between Java/Kotlin and C++ data types safely
3. WHEN audio operations complete THEN the system SHALL return results to Kotlin using appropriate callback mechanisms
4. IF JNI calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the Kotlin layer
5. WHEN multiple threads access JNI functions THEN the system SHALL ensure thread-safe operation without crashes
6. WHEN the audio engine is destroyed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all JNI references and native resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load and manage audio samples efficiently, so that I can work with multiple samples without running out of memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sample is loaded THEN the system SHALL read WAV files using the dr_wav library for reliable format support
2. WHEN loading samples THEN the system SHALL support both mono and stereo audio files
3. WHEN a sample is loaded successfully THEN the system SHALL store it in memory with efficient data structures
4. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to unload unused samples
5. IF a sample file is corrupted or unsupported THEN the system SHALL report specific error information
6. WHEN samples are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata including sample rate, channels, and duration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a beat maker, I want samples to play back immediately when triggered, so that I can create rhythms without noticeable delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sample playback is requested THEN the system SHALL start audio output within one audio buffer cycle
2. WHEN multiple samples are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL mix them together without audio dropouts
3. WHEN samples are playing THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent audio quality without clicks or pops
4. WHEN a sample finishes playing THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the voice without affecting other sounds
5. IF the audio buffer underruns THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without crashing
6. WHEN samples of different sample rates are played THEN the system SHALL handle resampling automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper voice management for polyphonic playback, so that multiple sounds can play simultaneously without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple samples are triggered THEN the system SHALL allocate separate voices for each active sound
2. WHEN the maximum voice count is reached THEN the system SHALL use voice stealing to free up resources for new sounds
3. WHEN voices are stolen THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping the most recently triggered or loudest sounds
4. WHEN a voice is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL return it to the available voice pool immediately
5. WHEN voice allocation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without affecting other playing sounds
6. WHEN voices are active THEN the system SHALL track their state and provide accurate playback information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a producer, I want real-time volume and pan controls, so that I can adjust the mix while creating music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN volume parameters are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes within the next audio buffer cycle
2. WHEN pan controls are adjusted THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between stereo positions without clicks
3. WHEN multiple parameters change simultaneously THEN the system SHALL apply all changes atomically
4. WHEN parameter changes occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL smooth the transitions to prevent audio artifacts
5. IF parameter values are out of range THEN the system SHALL clamp them to valid ranges automatically
6. WHEN parameters are set THEN the system SHALL store the values for consistent playback behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the audio engine to handle errors gracefully, so that audio problems don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio hardware errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery without terminating the app
2. WHEN sample loading fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with other loaded samples
3. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL free unused resources and retry the operation
4. IF the audio stream is disconnected THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
5. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging purposes
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely and allow the app to continue running

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive audio engine testing capabilities, so that I can verify functionality and diagnose issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test functions are called THEN the system SHALL generate synthetic audio samples for testing purposes
2. WHEN diagnostic functions are invoked THEN the system SHALL report current engine status and performance metrics
3. WHEN test samples are created THEN the system SHALL provide various waveforms (sine, noise, etc.) for different test scenarios
4. WHEN performance testing is requested THEN the system SHALL measure and report audio latency and CPU usage
5. IF test operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging
6. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up all test resources without affecting normal operation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the audio engine to integrate with Android's audio system properly, so that it works correctly with other audio apps and system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other apps request audio focus THEN the system SHALL pause playback and yield audio resources appropriately
2. WHEN audio focus is regained THEN the system SHALL resume operation automatically
3. WHEN headphones are connected or disconnected THEN the system SHALL adapt to the new audio routing without interruption
4. WHEN the system audio settings change THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to new sample rates or buffer sizes
5. IF audio permissions are revoked THEN the system SHALL handle the situation gracefully and inform the user
6. WHEN the device enters low-power mode THEN the system SHALL reduce audio processing to conserve battery life
