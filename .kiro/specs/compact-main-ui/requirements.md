# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for rebuilding TheOne's user interface to create a compact, feature-dense main screen that maximizes functionality accessibility. The goal is to transform the current navigation-based UI into a comprehensive MPC-style interface where users can access all core features without navigating between separate screens. This approach prioritizes workflow efficiency and mirrors the design philosophy of hardware MPCs where all essential controls are immediately accessible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Main Interface

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want all essential controls and features accessible on a single main screen, so that I can work efficiently without constantly navigating between different screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the main screen SHALL display all core functionality areas simultaneously
2. WHEN using the main screen THEN users SHALL be able to access sampling, sequencing, drum pads, MIDI controls, and transport controls without navigation
3. WHEN the screen real estate is limited THEN the interface SHALL use collapsible sections, tabs, or overlay panels to maximize space utilization
4. WHEN users interact with any feature THEN the response SHALL be immediate without screen transitions

### Requirement 2: Drum Pad Grid Integration

**User Story:** As a beat maker, I want the drum pad grid prominently displayed on the main screen, so that I can trigger samples instantly while working on other aspects of my track.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main screen THEN a 4x4 drum pad grid SHALL be prominently displayed
2. WHEN a pad is pressed THEN it SHALL trigger the assigned sample with visual feedback
3. WHEN a pad is long-pressed THEN it SHALL open pad configuration options in an overlay or sidebar
4. WHEN pads have samples assigned THEN they SHALL display visual indicators (waveform preview, sample name, or color coding)
5. WHEN MIDI input is received THEN the corresponding pad SHALL respond with the same visual feedback as touch input

### Requirement 3: Integrated Step Sequencer

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the step sequencer controls accessible on the main screen, so that I can program patterns while simultaneously triggering pads and adjusting other parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main screen THEN step sequencer controls SHALL be visible in a dedicated section
2. WHEN programming steps THEN users SHALL be able to see and edit at least 16 steps without scrolling
3. WHEN multiple tracks exist THEN users SHALL be able to switch between tracks using compact track selection controls
4. WHEN sequencer is playing THEN the current step SHALL be clearly highlighted with visual feedback
5. WHEN editing steps THEN velocity, probability, and other step parameters SHALL be accessible through compact controls

### Requirement 4: Transport and Playback Controls

**User Story:** As a performer, I want transport controls (play, stop, record) prominently accessible, so that I can control playback without interrupting my creative flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main screen THEN transport controls SHALL be prominently displayed and easily accessible
2. WHEN transport controls are pressed THEN they SHALL provide immediate audio feedback and visual state changes
3. WHEN recording THEN the record button SHALL provide clear visual indication of recording state
4. WHEN tempo needs adjustment THEN BPM controls SHALL be accessible without opening separate screens
5. WHEN using external MIDI clock THEN sync status SHALL be clearly displayed

### Requirement 5: Quick Access Feature Panels

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want quick access to sampling, MIDI settings, and other advanced features, so that I can adjust settings without losing context of my current work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced features are needed THEN they SHALL be accessible through slide-out panels, bottom sheets, or overlay dialogs
2. WHEN a feature panel is open THEN the main interface SHALL remain partially visible to maintain context
3. WHEN feature panels are closed THEN they SHALL not consume screen real estate
4. WHEN switching between feature panels THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain user context
5. WHEN panels contain complex controls THEN they SHALL be organized with clear visual hierarchy

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to adapt to different screen orientations and sizes, so that I can use the app effectively in both portrait and landscape modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is rotated THEN the layout SHALL automatically adapt to optimize space usage
2. WHEN in landscape mode THEN more horizontal space SHALL be utilized for sequencer steps and additional controls
3. WHEN in portrait mode THEN vertical space SHALL be efficiently used with collapsible sections
4. WHEN screen size is limited THEN less critical features SHALL be moved to secondary access methods
5. WHEN layout changes occur THEN user context and current state SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 7: Visual Feedback and Status Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback for all interactive elements and system status, so that I can understand the current state of the application at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any control is interacted with THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN level meters or visual indicators SHALL show audio activity
3. WHEN samples are loading THEN progress indicators SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN MIDI devices are connected THEN connection status SHALL be clearly visible
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed in a non-intrusive manner that doesn't disrupt workflow

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the compact interface to maintain smooth performance, so that the increased UI complexity doesn't impact audio performance or responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main screen is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps performance during normal operation
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN UI updates SHALL not cause audio dropouts or latency issues
3. WHEN multiple UI elements are updating simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize audio thread performance
4. WHEN memory usage increases due to UI complexity THEN it SHALL not exceed reasonable limits for target devices
5. WHEN the interface is idle THEN unnecessary UI updates SHALL be minimized to conserve battery

### Requirement 9: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the compact interface to remain accessible and usable, so that the increased density doesn't compromise usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using accessibility services THEN all controls SHALL remain properly labeled and navigable
2. WHEN touch targets are small due to space constraints THEN they SHALL still meet minimum size requirements for accessibility
3. WHEN color is used for status indication THEN alternative indicators SHALL be provided for color-blind users
4. WHEN text is displayed in compact areas THEN it SHALL remain readable at standard system font sizes
5. WHEN gesture controls are used THEN alternative access methods SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Customization and Workflow Adaptation

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to customize the layout and prioritize features based on my workflow, so that the interface adapts to my specific production style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users have different workflow preferences THEN they SHALL be able to customize which features are prominently displayed
2. WHEN certain features are rarely used THEN users SHALL be able to minimize or hide them
3. WHEN layout preferences are set THEN they SHALL be persisted across app sessions
4. WHEN multiple layout presets exist THEN users SHALL be able to switch between them quickly
5. WHEN customization options are accessed THEN they SHALL not require complex configuration procedures
