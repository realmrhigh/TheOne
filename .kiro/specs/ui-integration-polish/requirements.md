# UI Integration & Polish Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to polish the existing UI by ensuring all implemented functions are working and properly integrated into the main interface. The current system has recording functionality implemented but not accessible through the main UI, and several features need better integration and polish.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Recording Integration

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to access sample recording functionality directly from the main screen, so that I can quickly record samples without navigating to separate screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on the main screen THEN I SHALL see a recording button that is easily accessible
2. WHEN I tap the recording button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the microphone
3. WHEN recording is active THEN I SHALL see real-time level meters and recording duration
4. WHEN I stop recording THEN I SHALL be able to immediately assign the sample to a pad
5. IF recording fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry options

### Requirement 2: Feature Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all implemented features to be accessible from the main interface, so that I can use the full functionality of the app without hunting for hidden features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN I SHALL see all major features (recording, pads, sequencer, MIDI) accessible from the main screen
2. WHEN I interact with any feature THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN features are loading THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading states
4. WHEN features encounter errors THEN I SHALL see clear error messages with actionable solutions
5. IF a feature is not available THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate why and how to enable it

### Requirement 3: UI Polish & Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be polished and responsive, so that I can have a professional and smooth experience while making music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with any UI element THEN I SHALL see smooth animations and transitions
2. WHEN the app is under load THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive with appropriate performance optimizations
3. WHEN I use the app on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN I perform actions THEN I SHALL receive immediate haptic and visual feedback
5. IF the system is busy THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 4: Recording Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a beat maker, I want a streamlined recording workflow that integrates with the pad system, so that I can quickly record and use samples in my beats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I record a sample THEN I SHALL be able to immediately preview it with playback controls
2. WHEN I finish recording THEN I SHALL be able to assign the sample to any available pad with one tap
3. WHEN I assign a recorded sample THEN the pad SHALL immediately reflect the new sample visually
4. WHEN I record multiple samples THEN I SHALL be able to manage them efficiently
5. IF I want to re-record THEN I SHALL be able to easily retry without losing my workflow

### Requirement 5: Error Handling & Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling and recovery options, so that technical issues don't interrupt my creative workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any feature fails THEN I SHALL see a clear error message explaining what went wrong
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN I SHALL be provided with specific steps to resolve it
3. WHEN the audio engine fails THEN I SHALL be able to retry initialization without restarting the app
4. WHEN recording fails THEN I SHALL be able to check permissions and retry
5. IF the system is in an error state THEN I SHALL be able to reset to a working state

### Requirement 6: Performance & Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform well even on lower-end devices, so that I can make music without technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects performance issues THEN it SHALL automatically apply optimizations
2. WHEN frame rate drops below 50fps THEN the system SHALL reduce visual effects to maintain responsiveness
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL unload inactive components
4. WHEN audio latency is high THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and optimization suggestions
5. IF performance is critically low THEN the system SHALL offer a simplified mode
