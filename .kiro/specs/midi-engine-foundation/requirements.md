# MIDI Engine Foundation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MIDI Engine Foundation provides comprehensive MIDI input/output capabilities for TheOne, enabling integration with external MIDI hardware controllers, keyboards, and other MIDI devices. This foundation will support both receiving MIDI input for triggering samples and pads, as well as sending MIDI output for controlling external devices. The engine must provide low-latency, real-time MIDI processing that integrates seamlessly with the existing audio engine and sampling system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MIDI Input Processing

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to connect my MIDI keyboard or controller to TheOne so that I can trigger samples and control the application using physical hardware instead of just touch controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a MIDI device is connected to the Android device THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and list available MIDI devices
2. WHEN a user selects a MIDI input device THEN the system SHALL establish a connection and begin processing MIDI messages
3. WHEN a MIDI Note On message is received THEN the system SHALL trigger the corresponding pad or sample with velocity sensitivity
4. WHEN a MIDI Note Off message is received THEN the system SHALL stop the corresponding sample if it supports note-off behavior
5. WHEN a MIDI Control Change (CC) message is received THEN the system SHALL map it to the appropriate parameter based on user configuration
6. WHEN MIDI input latency exceeds 10ms THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning
7. IF no MIDI devices are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and continue functioning with touch input only

### Requirement 2: MIDI Output Generation

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want TheOne to send MIDI messages to external devices so that I can synchronize external hardware with my sequences and trigger external sounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pad is triggered in TheOne THEN the system SHALL optionally send a corresponding MIDI Note On message to connected output devices
2. WHEN a sequence is playing THEN the system SHALL send MIDI clock messages to maintain synchronization with external devices
3. WHEN the transport controls are used THEN the system SHALL send appropriate MIDI transport messages (Start, Stop, Continue)
4. WHEN parameter changes occur THEN the system SHALL optionally send MIDI CC messages based on user configuration
5. WHEN MIDI output is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain sample-accurate timing alignment between audio and MIDI output
6. IF a MIDI output device becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue functioning and notify the user of the disconnection

### Requirement 3: MIDI Device Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily manage my MIDI connections and configure how MIDI devices interact with TheOne so that I can customize my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MIDI settings screen is opened THEN the system SHALL display all available MIDI input and output devices
2. WHEN a user enables/disables a MIDI device THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the change without requiring an app restart
3. WHEN multiple MIDI devices are connected THEN the system SHALL allow simultaneous use of multiple input and output devices
4. WHEN a MIDI device is disconnected THEN the system SHALL detect the disconnection and update the UI accordingly
5. WHEN a previously connected device is reconnected THEN the system SHALL automatically restore the previous configuration
6. IF MIDI permissions are not granted THEN the system SHALL request permissions and provide clear instructions to the user

### Requirement 4: MIDI Mapping Configuration

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to customize how MIDI messages map to TheOne's functions so that I can optimize my workflow for my specific hardware setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing MIDI mapping settings THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to assign MIDI notes to specific pads
2. WHEN configuring CC mapping THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of MIDI controllers to parameters like volume, filter, effects
3. WHEN a MIDI learn mode is activated THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and assign the next received MIDI message to the selected parameter
4. WHEN custom mappings are created THEN the system SHALL save and restore these mappings across app sessions
5. WHEN conflicting MIDI mappings exist THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide resolution options
6. WHEN factory reset is requested THEN the system SHALL restore default MIDI mappings while preserving user data

### Requirement 5: MIDI Integration with Audio Engine

**User Story:** As a performer, I want MIDI input to integrate seamlessly with the audio engine so that there's no noticeable delay or timing issues when playing live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MIDI input triggers a sample THEN the system SHALL process the trigger with the same low-latency path as touch input
2. WHEN MIDI velocity data is received THEN the system SHALL apply velocity sensitivity to sample playback volume and timbre
3. WHEN MIDI input occurs during audio processing THEN the system SHALL queue messages for sample-accurate timing
4. WHEN the audio engine is under heavy load THEN MIDI processing SHALL maintain priority to prevent input lag
5. WHEN both MIDI and touch input occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle both inputs without conflicts
6. IF MIDI processing causes audio dropouts THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate buffering and priority management

### Requirement 6: MIDI Clock and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a producer working with multiple devices, I want TheOne to synchronize with external MIDI clock so that everything stays in perfect time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external MIDI clock is received THEN the system SHALL synchronize the internal sequencer tempo to the external clock
2. WHEN acting as MIDI clock master THEN the system SHALL send stable, accurate MIDI clock messages at the current tempo
3. WHEN MIDI Start/Stop/Continue messages are received THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately with transport control
4. WHEN tempo changes occur THEN the system SHALL smoothly adjust to new timing without audio glitches
5. WHEN MIDI clock sync is enabled THEN the system SHALL display sync status in the UI
6. IF MIDI clock becomes unstable or stops THEN the system SHALL fall back to internal timing and notify the user

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting MIDI issues, I want clear feedback about MIDI status and any problems so that I can resolve connectivity or configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MIDI errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN MIDI devices fail to connect THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested solutions
3. WHEN MIDI input is not responding THEN the system SHALL provide a MIDI monitor/test interface
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL display warnings and suggest optimizations
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide real-time MIDI message monitoring
6. IF system resources are insufficient for MIDI processing THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform the user
