TheOne
Project Genesis & Workflow
This is an insane project that I have undertaken solo as a complete programming noob, against my better judgement. I want to see how far I can push the power of AI coding. 
By using this plan to portion out tasks, we prevent information overload to keep the AI focused; this will help prevent getting stuck in an error loop. 
I know music and audio very well, but not the instrumentation, programming, and guts of the synths and effects.

Gemini has been the brains of the operation, Jules is the most efficient code robot and only writes professional code, and I am trying to soak up as much information as possible as I coordinate technology to create 
something incredible.

Our workflow goes like this: me and Gemini assess the previous code and determine next steps. Those steps are listed out with direct and defined objectives to be passed to Jules. Jules makes a plan, and that plan 
is screenshotted and sent to Gemini to be verified or amended; if amended, we repeat the plan and verification. Jules writes and publishes code to a new branch, that branch is opened in a new Gemini chat for 
assessment and planning, and the development cycle repeats.

MPC Android App: Technical Specification & Build Map
I. Introduction
This document outlines the detailed build map and development framework for an MPC-style sampler and drum machine application on Android. It specifies key data structures, API signatures, UI component properties, 
and configuration parameters to provide maximum clarity for the AI development team. The aim is to ensure all developers are aligned on the technical specifications of their respective modules.

II. Core Architectural Principles
To ensure a scalable, maintainable, and collaborative development process, the following architectural principles will be adopted:

Modular Design: The application will be broken down into distinct, self-contained modules (Core Engines, Feature Modules). Each module will have well-defined responsibilities and interfaces.
Primary Language: Kotlin will be the primary programming language due to its modern features, conciseness, and official Android support.
Audio Engine Core: For performance-critical audio processing, C++ will be used for the core of the Audio Engine, accessed via JNI (Java Native Interface). Android's Oboe library is highly recommended for achieving 
low-latency audio.
UI Framework: Jetpack Compose will be used for building the user interface, enabling a modern, declarative, and efficient UI development workflow.
Architectural Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or MVI (Model-View-Intent) will be implemented to separate concerns.
Dependency Injection: Hilt will be used for managing dependencies.
Asynchronous Operations: Kotlin Coroutines will be used extensively for managing background tasks.
Defined APIs: Clear and stable APIs will be defined for communication between modules.
Version Control: Git will be used for version control, with a feature-branch workflow.
Testing: Unit tests (JUnit, Mockito/MockK), integration tests, and UI tests (Espresso or Compose testing utilities) will be integral to the development process.
III. Key Global Data Models & Enums
These are foundational data structures defined in a shared core.model module.
