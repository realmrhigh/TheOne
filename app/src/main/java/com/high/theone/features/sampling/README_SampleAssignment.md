- **Sample Comparison**: Side-by-side view of current vs. new sample
- **Bulk Replacement**: Handle multiple replacements with single confirmation
- **Detailed Information**: Show sample metadata for informed decisions

### 6. Sample Management (`SampleManagement.kt`)
**Requirements: 7.3**

- **Sample Renaming**: Edit sample names with validation
- **Sample Duplication**: Create copies of existing samples
- **Sample Deletion**: Safe deletion with usage warnings
- **Tag Management**: Add, remove, and organize sample tags
- **Usage Information**: Show which pads use each sample
- **File Information**: Display comprehensive sample metadata

Management Features:
- Usage-aware deletion (prevents deletion of assigned samples)
- Tag editor with add/remove functionality
- Comprehensive sample information display
- Action-based interface with clear descriptions

### 7. Sample Usage Tracker (`SampleUsageTracker.kt`)
**Requirements: 7.3**

- **Usage Analytics**: Track sample usage patterns and statistics
- **Pad Assignment Tracking**: Monitor which samples are assigned where
- **Trigger Counting**: Count how many times each sample is triggered
- **Usage Indicators**: Visual indicators for usage levels (unused, low, active, heavy)
- **Detailed Analytics**: In-depth usage statistics and trends

Analytics Features:
- Total triggers per sample
- Average velocity tracking
- First/last used timestamps
- Usage breakdown by pad
- Visual usage indicators

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components

1. **PadConfigurationDialog**: Enhanced with new sample browser
2. **SamplingScreen**: Integration points for sample assignment workflow
3. **SampleRepository**: Uses existing repository interface for data operations
4. **SamplingModels**: Leverages existing data models (PadState, SampleMetadata)

### Data Flow

```
Sample Browser → Sample Selection → Assignment Workflow → Pad Configuration → Audio Engine
     ↓                ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
Usage Tracking ← Sample Management ← Repository Operations ← State Updates ← Playback
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- Uses Compose Foundation's experimental drag-and-drop APIs
- Provides haptic feedback for better user experience
- Includes fallback tap-to-assign for accessibility

### 2. Safety Mechanisms
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Usage-aware deletion prevention
- Clear visual feedback for all operations

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large sample libraries
- Efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Minimal recomposition through proper state management

### 4. Accessibility
- Alternative assignment methods for users who can't use drag-and-drop
- Clear visual indicators and text descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support where applicable

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sample Assignment
```kotlin
// Drag sample from browser to pad
SampleAssignmentWorkflow(
    pads = uiState.pads,
    samples = uiState.availableSamples,
    onSampleAssign = { padIndex, sampleId ->
        viewModel.assignSampleToPad(padIndex, sampleId)
    }
)
```

### Sample Management
```kotlin
// Manage individual sample
SampleManagementDialog(
    sample = selectedSample,
    usageInfo = sampleUsageInfo,
    onRename = { newName -> viewModel.renameSample(sample.id, newName) },
    onDelete = { viewModel.deleteSample(sample.id) }
)
```

### Usage Tracking
```kotlin
// Track sample usage
SampleUsageTracker(
    samples = allSamples,
    pads = currentPads,
    usageStats = usageStatistics,
    onShowSampleDetails = { sample -> showSampleAnalytics(sample) }
)
```

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests Needed
- Sample filtering and search logic
- Assignment workflow state management
- Usage statistics calculations
- Import progress tracking

### Integration Tests Needed
- End-to-end assignment workflow
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- File import process
- Sample management operations

### UI Tests Needed
- Sample browser interactions
- Pad assignment visual feedback
- Confirmation dialog flows
- Bulk operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by audio characteristics (BPM, key, etc.)
2. **Sample Categories**: Organize samples into categories/folders
3. **Cloud Integration**: Sync samples across devices
4. **Sample Sharing**: Share samples between users
5. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Suggest samples based on usage patterns

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large sample libraries
2. **Thumbnail Generation**: Visual waveform thumbnails
3. **Caching**: Intelligent caching of sample metadata
4. **Background Processing**: Async sample analysis and indexing

## Conclusion

The Sample Assignment System provides a comprehensive, user-friendly solution for managing samples and assigning them to pads. It combines intuitive drag-and-drop functionality with powerful management features and detailed usage analytics, creating a professional-grade sample management experience for mobile music production.

All components are designed to work seamlessly with the existing audio engine and UI framework, ensuring consistent performance and user experience across the application.
