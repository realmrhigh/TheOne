## Usage Examples

### Advanced Step Programming
```kotlin
// Set step probability to 75%
patternManager.setStepProbability(pattern, padIndex = 0, stepIndex = 4, probability = 0.75f)

// Set step to play every 3rd time
patternManager.setStepCondition(pattern, padIndex = 1, stepIndex = 8, 
    condition = StepCondition.EveryNTimes(3))

// Apply humanization
patternManager.setStepHumanization(pattern, padIndex = 0, stepIndex = 0,
    humanization = StepHumanization(timingVariation = 5f, velocityVariation = 0.2f, enabled = true))
```

### Groove Template Application
```kotlin
// Apply MPC-style groove
val mpcGroove = GroovePresets.MPC_60
val groovedPattern = pattern.withGroove(mpcGroove)

// Analyze pattern groove
val analysis = pattern.analyzeGroove()
val suggestedTemplate = analysis.getSuggestedTemplate()
```

### Performance Monitoring
```kotlin
// Start monitoring
performanceMonitor.startMonitoring()

// Record step trigger
performanceMonitor.recordStepTrigger(
    expectedTime = expectedTimestamp,
    actualTime = actualTimestamp,
    stepIndex = 4,
    padIndex = 0
)

// Get performance report
val report = performanceMonitor.getPerformanceReport()
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Thread Safety
- All performance monitoring uses thread-safe collections
- Step condition evaluation is atomic and lock-free
- Groove template application is immutable and safe for concurrent access

### Memory Management
- Performance metrics use circular buffers to limit memory usage
- Groove templates are lightweight and cached efficiently
- Advanced step features add minimal memory overhead per step

### Performance Impact
- Step condition evaluation adds <1ms per step
- Humanization calculations are pre-computed where possible
- Performance monitoring runs on separate thread to avoid audio interference

### Extensibility
- New step conditions can be added by extending StepCondition sealed class
- Custom groove algorithms can be implemented via GrooveTemplate interface
- Performance metrics can be extended with additional measurement types

This implementation provides a comprehensive set of advanced features that transform the basic step sequencer into a professional-grade rhythm programming tool with sophisticated timing control, groove manipulation, and performance optimization capabilities.
