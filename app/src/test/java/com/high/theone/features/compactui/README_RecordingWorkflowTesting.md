## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example CI configuration
test_recording_workflow:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run Recording Workflow Tests
      run: ./gradlew test --tests "RecordingWorkflowTestSuite"
    
    - name: Generate Coverage Report
      run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverage
    
    - name: Upload Coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
      with:
        file: app/build/reports/coverage/test/debug/report.xml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Issues

1. **Audio Engine Mock Setup**
   - Ensure all audio engine methods are properly mocked
   - Verify return values match expected behavior

2. **Compose Test Timing**
   - Use `waitForIdle()` after UI interactions
   - Use `waitUntil()` for state-dependent assertions

3. **Performance Test Variability**
   - Run performance tests multiple times for averages
   - Account for CI environment performance differences

4. **Memory Test Accuracy**
   - Force garbage collection before memory measurements
   - Use consistent measurement points across tests

### Test Environment Setup

Ensure your test environment has:
- Sufficient memory for performance tests
- Audio device simulation capabilities
- Proper mock framework configuration
- Compose testing dependencies

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the recording workflow meets all requirements for integration, performance, error handling, and quality standards.
