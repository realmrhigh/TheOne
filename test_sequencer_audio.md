# Sequencer Audio Integration Test

## Overview
This document outlines how to test the sequencer audio functionality to ensure it's working properly.

## Current Implementation Status âœ…

### Audio Integration Features
1. **AudioEngineControl Integration**: âœ… Connected to audio engine interface
2. **Manual Pad Triggering**: âœ… Click pads to hear immediate audio
3. **Sequencer Playback**: âœ… Real-time step sequencing with audio
4. **Transport Controls**: âœ… Play/pause/stop with audio feedback
5. **Test Functions**: âœ… Built-in audio testing capabilities

### Test Methods Available

#### 1. Manual Testing via UI
- **Test Audio Button**: Tests audio engine connectivity and initialization
- **Test Pad 0 Button**: Manually triggers pad 0 for immediate audio feedback
- **Add Test Beat Button**: Creates a test pattern with kick, snare, and hi-hat
- **Pad Selection**: Click any pad in the pad selector to hear audio

#### 2. Sequencer Playback Testing
- Select pads in the pad selector (they will be highlighted)
- Press the Play button to start sequencer
- Watch the step indicator move and listen for audio on selected pads
- Use tempo controls to change playback speed

#### 3. Pattern Programming Testing
- Use "Add Test Beat" to create a basic drum pattern
- Select the test pattern from the pattern list
- Press play to hear the programmed beat

## Audio Engine Methods Used

### Primary Methods
- `playPadSample(noteInstanceId, trackId, padId)` - Main sequencer playback
- `triggerDrumPad(padIndex, velocity)` - Alternative drum pad triggering
- `triggerTestPadSample(padIndex)` - Test sample triggering

### Initialization & Testing
- `initializeDrumEngine()` - Initialize drum engine
- `createAndTriggerTestSample()` - Create and test sample
- `getReportedLatencyMillis()` - Check audio latency
- `debugPrintDrumEngineState()` - Debug audio engine state

## Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly
1. **Pad Clicks**: Should produce immediate audio feedback
2. **Sequencer Play**: Should play audio in time with the tempo
3. **Step Indicator**: Should move smoothly and sync with audio
4. **Test Buttons**: Should provide audio feedback and log success
5. **Pattern Playback**: Test pattern should play kick, snare, hi-hat pattern

### Troubleshooting

#### No Audio Heard
1. Check device volume is up
2. Check audio permissions are granted
3. Look for "SequencerAudio" logs in logcat
4. Try different test methods (pad trigger, drum trigger, test sample)
5. Check if audio engine is initialized properly

#### Logs to Monitor
- `SimpleSequencerViewModel`: Main sequencer operations
- `SequencerAudio`: Audio-specific operations
- `AudioEngineImpl`: Low-level audio operations

## Test Sequence

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
1. Open sequencer screen
2. Click "Test Audio" button - should see logs
3. Click "Test Pad 0" button - should hear audio
4. Click any pad in pad selector - should hear audio
5. Press Play button - should hear sequenced audio

### Full Test (5 minutes)
1. Run quick test first
2. Click "Add Test Beat" button
3. Select the "Test Beat" pattern
4. Press Play - should hear drum pattern
5. Adjust tempo - pattern should speed up/slow down
6. Select different pads and press Play - should hear different combinations

## Current Status: âœ… READY FOR TESTING

The sequencer audio integration is complete and ready for testing. All necessary components are in place:
- Audio engine connectivity
- Manual pad triggering
- Sequencer playback timing
- Test functions and UI
- Comprehensive logging

## Next Steps
1. Test the audio functionality using the methods above
2. If audio works: Sequencer is fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
3. If no audio: Check troubleshooting steps and logs
4. Report any issues found during testing
